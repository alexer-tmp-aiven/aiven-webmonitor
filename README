Webmonitor
==========

Monitors website availability and response time, and logs the results to postgresql through kafka.

Setup
=====

First, log in with avn (aiven-client), and select the project you want.

Then, run:

  $ python create_services.py <path/to/where_you_want_the_config>

When the script finishes, you'll still need to edit the configuration
file to configure the web sites you want to monitor. The script will
print the command lines needed to run the programs for you.
